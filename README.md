# Advertising-Sales-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Technique

1. In this project, I have basically made a simple linear regresiion model to include multiple features.

2.  In this project, I used scikit-learn's LinearRegression( ) estimator to calculate the multiple regression coefficient estimates when TV, radio, and newspaper advertising budgets are used to predict sales revenue

3. The dataset can be found here:

4. I have used Yellowbrick here so that it  extends the Scikit-Learn API to make model selection and hyperparameter tuning  model easily(for Visualization purposes).
